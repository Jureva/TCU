        <h2 class="w3-center"> About TCU </h2>

    		<p>
    		Tallaght Centre for unemployed Ltd. (TCU) is a community resource centre based in the heart of Tallaght Village. The board of the management is a volunteer group who are a sponsoring body for the projects and the employees are participants on Community Employment and Jobs Initiative programmes.
TCU has very successfully sponsored a number of valuable CE schemes that make an important contribution to the development and provision of community based services while still maintaining its focus on the needs of the CE programme and participants.
The CE projects sponsored by TCU provide a wide range of facilities and support services that benefit the needs of the local community, particularly those affected by unemployment, poverty or economic disadvantage, those who are socially excluded or marginalised within the community.
TCU continues to help local groups and organisations through our continuing support and collaboration; we encourage greater interaction within the community initiatives that enables those affected by unemployment and poverty issues to cope with their circumstances in a dignified manner.
The needs of the local community are identified directly through the people who use the centre, whether they are unemployed or actively employed, also, through liaison with social welfare, local organisations and community groups.
</p>
    		<p>
    		The benefits occurring as a result of the operations of TCU schemes include:
<br>	The people who participate on our CE schemes are trained to a very high standard in administration, accounts and childcare and many go on to employment or further education. While on the schemes they gain valuable experience and expert knowledge of organisations locally and the existing services they provide. Communication skills are improved through dealings with the public, and they leave better equipped to pursue career prospects.
<br>	Local people who are long term unemployed are disadvantaged because of their circumstances, Tallaght Centre is a place where they are treated as equals and the facility provides a service that can help them fulfil their needs whether it is to source information or provide access to other services. These individuals can do so in an environment that is beneficial to their needs without feeling victimized or targeted.
<br>	People are better informed of the options available to them and are assisted in preparation for employment opportunities due to the quality of information and service they receive in the centre. The centre also provides work experience opportunities to individuals who are training or participating on programmes outside the centre.
<br>	Through education, training, re-training and everyday assistance, TCU makes every effort to provide a better quality of life for individuals and groups who are supported by us.

<br>TCU is a long established and well respected resource centre in the heart of Tallaght Village. Officially opened in 1990, the centre was set up in the early 80’s to cater for the needs of unemployed people due to the lack of facilities and services in Tallaght and surrounding area.
